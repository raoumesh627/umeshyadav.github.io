    <h1>Vincent van Gogh</h1>

    <h2>
      Among the most famous figures in Western art, Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890)
      was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who created about 2,100 artworks.
      They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and
      are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive
      brushwork.
    </h2>

    <h3>The Arles Years</h3>
    <p>
      Van Gogh's two years at Arles in France (1888–89) were one of his most
      artistically productive periods. He was enchanted by the local countryside
      and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, ultramarine and
      mauve. Among the most well-known works of that time is an oil painting of
      his rented room, entitled <i>Bedroom in Arles</i>.

    <p>
      In Arles, the painter began a friendship with the owners of a local hotel,
      known as the Cafe de la Gare. The building inspired two more famous
      creations. The first of which is known as <i>The Yellow House</i>.

    </p>

    <p>
      The second painting is one of many people's favourites:
      <i>The Cafe Terrace at Night</i>. The location at the Place du Forum in
      Arles was refurbished to replicate van Gogh's painting.

    <h3>Life, Suffering and Death</h3>
    <p>
      After his time at Arles, van Gogh moved to a former monastery at nearby
      Saint-Remy. The building's garden and surrounding countryside became the
      main subjects of his paintings. Some of his works from this time are
      characterised by swirls, such as <i>The Starry Night</i>.

      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Van Gogh suffered from mental illness all his life. He was not
      commercially successful, and his suicide at aged 37 came after years of
      poverty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Van Gogh is known to have sold only a single painting in his lifetime; for
      400 francs or about €1,800 in today's value. In 1990, one of his
      paintings, <i>Portrait of Dr. Gachet</i>, fetched $82.5 million at
      auction.
